                This website goes through the narrative of conspiracies which says that perhaps we co-exist with     aliens and they’ve infiltrated our society seamlessly without humankind knowing. They are ‘unseen’ to us and hiding within our planet. 
                <br>
                Although we have been residing on Earth for millions of years, there are many aspects of it unknown to us, particularly the ocean. Bodies of water make up the vast majority of our planet; however, we’ve barely explored any of it. We know nothing of the creatures which bury themselves deep into the dark trenches of the waters. Perhaps there could be a chance that alien civilization exists in our oceans. Many have conspired that creatures such as octopuses show alien like intelligence, hiding from security guards and escaping aquariums. There are even a select few who believe that perhaps octopuses’ eggs or genes originated from outer space and entered our planet through means of meteors. 
                <br>
                Another conspiracy describes the differing types of aliens and their superhuman abilities. Some believe that creatures such as lizard people shape shift and live within our civilization. These extraterrestrials are thought to have connections to those in higher power such as those with wealth and fame which allows them to get connections to live among us and study our lifestyle.
                <br>
                At the end of the day, what do we mean by ‘aliens’. In a sense we are considered ‘aliens’ to other lifeforms which may reside in other solar systems within the billions of galaxies we’ve discovered (this doesn’t even account for the areas which we’ve never looked upon!). Do you really believe that within the vast darkness of space, only our speck of a planet is able to contain living beings?
